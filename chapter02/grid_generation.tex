\subsection{Overset Grids}

The overset grid method was developed by Benek, Buning, and Steger10 to allow the structured grid flow solvers of the 1980â€™s to be easily extended to more complex geometries than the grid generators would support at that time. 

For modeling flows with viscosity about geometrically complex bodies in relative motion, the Chimera-overset-grid method is among the most computationally cost-effective methods for obtaining accurate aerodynamic results.

\subsection{Flow Solver}

Newton or dual-time sub-iterations are used to improve the accuracy of unsteady simulations, and can also improve the robustness of steady or unsteady simulations.  The sub-iterations improve the solution accuracy near interpolated and extrapolated boundaries and also reduce the global solution error at a given time step.  The solution is advanced one physical time step (DTPHYS) at the end of each sub-iteration cycle when Newton or dual-time sub-iterations are used.  In the following example 5 dual-time sub-iterations are used with second-order time advancement.  Note that the computational time step (DT) does not have to equal the physical time step (DTPHYS).  Also, the computational time step (DT) is non-dimensionalized by the free-stream speed of sound, while the physical time step (DTPHYS) is non-dimensionalized by the reference velocity.
