abstract = {This paper documents the programmatic context and considerations that have shaped the development and execution of a number of research initiatives implemented by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research Aerothermodynamics and Turbulence portfolio since 2001. The National Hypersonic Foundational Research Plan has been developed in concert with NASA and Sandia National Laboratories to coordinate strategic planning in the scientific disciplines relevant to hypersonic technologies. The HIFiRE program has provided flight data to provide insight into the behavior of critical phenomena in-flight and helped address several key objectives identified in the National Hypersonic Foundational Research Plan. The STAR initiative facilitated the transition of knowledge and capabilities from basic research to technology development and has made key contributions to national-scale programs and Test and Evaluation capabilities. In the future the portfolio will focus on energy transfer mechanisms between kinetic, internal and chemical modes as a potential approach to new flow control capabilities and to expand the contributions of the portfolio to other areas of interest to the Air Force.},

abstract = {Experiments have been conducted herein at Mach 1.4 to determine the effect on normal shock stability of a micro-ramp array, ramped vane arrays, porous plates over a cavity, and an open cavity as compared to no control (solid wall) in the region of a 5 o diffuser. For each of the control devices, the mean position and standard deviation in position of the normal shock were determined for a set stagnation pressure over the range of tunnel stagnation pressures from 134.4 to 148.2 kPa using schlieren photography. For each of the set stagnation pressures, the boundary layer static pressure fluctuations downstream of the diffuser entrance were also obtained for each control device. An array of three micro-ramps and an array of three ramped vanes, whose heights were scaled to 40{\%} of the incoming boundary layer thickness, were placed ahead of the normal shock, as well as an array of two ramped vanes with a height of 0.6 the incoming boundary layer thickness. Three porous plate configurations with a porosity of 5{\%} were also examined with varying lengths and positions. The open cavity used was 13.5 and 5 incoming boundary layer thicknesses long and deep, respectively. It was demonstrated that the control devices did affect shock stability in the region of the diffuser, both increasing and decreasing shock stability depending on shock position. Schlieren photography showed the micro-vortex generators reduced fluctuations of normal shock position when the shock moved into the diffuser, while slightly increasing fluctuations in shock position when the mean shock position was upstream of the diffuser entrance. The porous plate that terminated 3.5 incoming boundary layer thicknesses upstream of the diffuser entrance reduced the shock position fluctuations near the diffuser entrance. High frequency wall pressure measurements showed that the open cavity should not be used to improve stability. Also, the standard deviation of the wall static pressure fluctuations inside the diffuser was improved with the micro-vortex generators when the mean shock position was near and downstream of the diffuser shoulder.

However, it is generally impractical to build a single grid of this type for complex three-dimensional aircraft configurations. As a result, a trend in computational aerodynamics has been toward the use of composite grids. Composite grids use more than one grid to mesh an overall configuration with each individual subgrid of the system patched or overset together. Because each individual subgrid in the system is well ordered, the overall grid is suitable for efficient finite difference solution using vectorized or multitasking computers. Some of the advantages and difficulties of using various composite grid schemes are reviewed in this paper. ?? 1987.},

abstract = {Unclassified Unclassified I 15. Supplementary Notes 16. Abstract An analytical bleed system design procedure is applied t o a Mach 3.5, axisymmetric, translating centerbody inlet. The design features a traveling centerbody bleed system with a ducting arrangement separating low-, medium-, and high-pressure bleed. Three forward plenums and nine throat plenums are installed on the centerbody to meet the bleed requirements in the started Mach range between 1.6 and 3.5. The cowl contains four stationary plenums, three for forward and one for throat bleed. To achieve maximum bleed plenum pressure and thereby minimize bleed drag all bleed holes are inclined 20" to the surface except in the cowl throat region. Here the requirement of high stability margin with minimum total pressure recovery penalty resulted in 90' bleed holes. The bleed hole diameter varies from bleed plenum t o bleed plenum to achieve the most efficient boundary layer control, while the bleed exits are sized to operate at the highest possible plenum pressure without unchoking the bleed holes. Bleed flow rates, bleed plenum pressures, and boundary layer development along the cowl and centerbody are predicted over the entire started Mach range.},

The result is a significantly improved model that applies to both boundary layers and free shear flows and that has very little sensitivity to finite freestream boundary conditions on turbulence properties. The improvements to the k-! model facilitate a significant expansion of its range of applicability. The new model, like preceding versions, provides accurate solutions for mildly separated flows and simple geometries such as that of a backward-facing step. The model's improvement over earlier versions lies in its accuracy for even more complicated separated flows. This paper demonstrates the enhanced capability for supersonic flow into compression corners and a hypersonic shock-wave/ boundary-layer interaction.

@inproceedings{Clemens2009,
abstract = {Shock wave / boundary layers interactions occur in wide-range of supersonic internal and external flows, and often these interactions are associated with severe turbulent boundary layer separation. The shock-induced separation is associated with unsteady motions that are characterized by a wide range of frequencies, which include those characteristic of the upstream boundary layer as well as motions whose frequencies are about two orders of magnitude lower. Despite significant work over the past few decades, the source of the low-frequency motions is still an open question and is currently a topic of intense debate. Owing to a flurry of activity over the past decade on this single topic, both by computational and experimental researchers, we are close to developing a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that lead to low-frequency unsteadiness. Recent investigations on the source of low-frequency unsteadiness have provided what seems to be contradictory evidence since some indicate that the driving mechanism resides in the upstream boundary layer, whereas others suggest the dominant mechanism is an intrinsic instability of the separated flow. In this paper, based on a review of the evidence, we argue for a view where both processes are present in all shock-induced turbulent separated flows, but the relative importance of each mechanism depends on the severity of separation. In cases where the separation bubble is small, such as occurs for a small flow deflection or at high Reynolds number, then momentum fluctuations near the wall cause a direct movement of the separation line and can lead to collapse of the separation bubble. Upstream fluctuations may also pass through the separation shock, grow in the separated shear layer, and cause flapping of the reattachment point. In cases where the separation bubble is large, then the bubble pulsates owing to a global instability, and upstream turbulence serves mainly as a source of broadband frequencies that seed the large-scale instability of the separated flow. For strong separation, the separation line (and separation shock foot) is influenced on a small-scale by boundary layer momentum fluctuations, but large-scale motions are driven by reattachment line fluctuations.

Seven multiple hole configurations and two single slot configurations were tested over a supersonic Mach number range of 1.3 to 2.5 (nominal). Advantages gained by using multiple holes in a bleed region instead of a single spanwise slot are discussed and the issue of modeling an entire array of bleed orifices based on the performance of a single orifice is addressed.

abstract = {The effects of unsteady separation on the structure of a turbulent boundary layer were explored using wall-resolved, implicit large eddy simulation. The configuration used for this computation was a compression ramp of 24 degrees in a Mach 2.25 flow. This configuration was chosen because it has been shown to undergo shock-induced separation in previous work. A turbulent boundary layer was generated by imposing an artificial body force trip on a laminar boundary layer, and allowing it to develop into a fully turbulent flow. The resulting static pressure profile, skin friction coefficient, and boundary layer profile showed good agreement with other computations run at the same conditions. Data were recorded before and after the shock-wave / separation system to observe the changes in turbulence statistics. The effects on the Reynolds stresses were of particular interest for application in turbulence modeling. Large-scale, low-frequency pressure fluctuations caused by unsteadiness of the initial shock were also evaluated.},

@article{Jia2016,
abstract = {One of the key components of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) receiving terminal is the boil-off gas (BOG) compressor, which is used to pump out the BOG from the LNG storage tank to ensure safety in the transportation and receiving systems. Owing to the ultra-low suction temperature, the heat exchange between the intake gas and the cylinder, piston, and cylinder cover cannot be ignored as in normal conditions. This paper presents an investigation focusing on suction heating of the BOG compressor. A finite element model with dynamic mesh was established to simulate the suction process. At the same time, a performance test rig was built to study the characteristics of the BOG compressor under low suction temperature conditions and verify the numerical model. Consequently, the results of the simulation were in good agreement with experimental results. Both results implied that the temperature of cylinder surface increased starting from the cylinder cover to the crankcase. In addition, at lower suction temperature, the temperature difference between various points on the cylinder surface and cylinder cover was much larger than that at higher suction temperature. With increasing suction temperature, the temperature coefficient increased markedly, and the difference between gas temperatures at the beginning and end of the suction process, as well as the compressor flow rate, decreased significantly; however, the volumetric efficiency increased first and then decreased. Furthermore, the temperature coefficient clearly increased when the compressor rotational speed increased from 250rpm to 3000rpm, and it decreased from 0.81 to 0.66 as the pressure ratio increased from 3.0 to 6.0.},

Models were tested in the turbulent boundary layers on the tunnel floor and on a full-span flat plate. The nominal freestream Mach number was 5, the freestreani unit Reynolds number 53xl0 6 m-1 , and the wall temperature approximately adiabatic. Using a conditional sampling algorithm, distributions of the shock frequency, shock period, and shock speeds in the upstream and downstream directions have been calculated. The shock frequency distributions are broadband, and the most probable frequencies are low, typically less than 2 kHz. The mean and maximum shock speeds are also low, about 6 and 20{\%} of the freestream velocity, respectively, the results support a simple model suggesting that pressure fluctuations in the separated flow may drive the shock motion.},

abstract = {4 particle method which applies the probability density function (PDF) method to compressible tur-bulent flows is presented. Solution of the PDF equa-tion is achieved using a Lagrangian/Monte Carlo ap-proach. A unique feature of the method is its abil-ity to calculate the mean pressure gradient directly from the particles using a grid-free approach. This is accomplished by merging techniques borrowed from the field of smoothed particle hydrodynamics. Fur-thermore, these techniques have been implemented using a newly discovered algorithm which greatly re-duces the computational work in 1D. The particle method also incorporates a variance-reduction tech-nique which can significantly reduce statistical error in first and second moments of selected mean flow quantities. When combined with a second-order ac-curate predictor/corrector scheme, the resulting par-ticle method provides a feasible way to obtain accu-rate P D F solutions to unsteady compressible tur-bulent flow problems. Results have been obtained for a variety of quasi-1D flows to demonstrate the method's robustness. Convergence of the method with respect to four different kinds of numerical er-rors h a s also been studied through two test cases.

abstract = {Three-dimensional shock control bumps have long been investigated for their promising wave drag reduction “ ” capability. However, a recently emerging application has been their deployment as smart vortex generators, which offset the parasitic drag of their vortices against their wave drag reduction. It is known that three-dimensional shock control bumps produce streamwise vortices under most operating conditions; however, there have been very few investigations that have aimed to specifically examine the relevant flow structures. In particular, the strength of the vortices produced as well as the factors influencing their production are not well known. This paper uses a joint experimental and computational approach to test three different shock control bump shapes, categorizing their flow structures. Four common key vortical structures are observed, predominantly shear flows, although all bumps also produce a streamwise vortex pair. Both cases with and without flow separation on the bump tails are scrutinized. Finally, correlations between the strength of the mainwakevortices andpressure gradients at various locations onthe bumps are assessed to investigate which parts of the flow control the vortex formation. Spanwise flows on the bump ramp are seen to be the most influential factor in vortex strength. Nomenclature},

abstract = {The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) literature now fully recognizes that certain finite-element dis-cretizations of the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations (closed with a turbulence model), rou-tinely encounter non-physical states on under-resolved meshes and during their path to non-linear conver-gence. This work presents a formulation of the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) turbulence model that is designed to be stable and robust to these non-physical states (negative values of given turbulence working variable). This work outlines the design and testing of the negative S-A turbulence model (S-A-neg), which is particularly well suited for arbitrarily high-order finite-element discretizations. This S-A-neg model is designed to be energy stable as well as mitigate the non-linearity of the previously derived negative continuation source and diffusion operators. Additionally, this negative continuation of the S-A model reduces to the original model in properly resolved regions of the flow, where the solution to the turbulence-working variable is positive. Numerical ex-amples carried out using both continuous-and discontinuous-finite-element methods are used to demonstrate that this variant of the S-A model is robust for finite-element discretizations.},

abstract = {An all new, automated version of the PEGASUS software has been developed and tested. PEGASUS provides the hole-cutting and connectivity information between overlapping grids and is used as the final part of the grid-generation process for overset-grid computational fluid dynamics approaches. The new PEGASUS code (Version 5) has many new features: automated hole cutting, a projection scheme for fixing small discretization errors in overset surfaces, more efficient interpolation search methods using an alternating digital tree and a stencil-jumping scheme, hole-size optimization based on adding additional layers of fringe points, and an automatic restart capability. The new code has also been parallelized using the message-passing interface standard. The parallelization performance provides efficient speedup of the execution time by an order of magnitude, and up to a factor of 30 for very large problems. The results of two example cases are presented: a three-element high-lift airfoil and a complete Boeing 777-200 aircraft in a high-lift landing configuration. Comparisons of the computed flowfields for these test cases between the old and new versions of the PEGASUS codes show excellent agreement with each other and with experimental results.},

abstract = {The accuracy of two general interpolation methods was investigated within the context of developing a high-order overset grid flow solver. The two meth-ods, a generalized Lagrangian method and a basis-spline method, were examined using a one-dimensional Fourier error analysis. The local and integrated er-ror was reduced for both implicit and explicit La-grangian methods by optimizing the coefficients at the expense of reducing formal order of accuracy. For the stencil sizes investigated here, the optimized im-plicit interpolation methods were shown to possess integrated errors many orders of magnitude lower than the basis-spline, non-optimized or optimized explicit methods. The generalized Lagrangian interpolation method was chosen for implementation with an estab-lished high-order flow solver to produce a high-order overset grid capability. A two-dimensional benchmark problem of an inviscid, connecting vortex was solved using this capability on an overset grid system con-sisting of both Cartesian and curvilinear grids. Initial results showed substantial improvement in the com-puted solution for the optimized implicit interpolation method when compared to the bilinear interpolation method. The optimized implicit method reduced the maximum difference between the computed and exact solutions by a factor of 9.4 when compared to the bi-linear method.},

@article{Eagle2014,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} {\textcopyright} 2014 Cambridge University Press. The interaction between two separated flow regions was studied for the fundamental problem of a shock wave-boundary layer interaction (SBLI) within a rectangular inlet. One motivation is that the inlet of an engine on a supersonic aircraft may contain separation zones on the sidewalls and the bottom wall; if one region separates first it can alter the flow on the other wall and lead to engine unstart. In our work an oblique shock wave was generated by a wedge suspended from the upper wall of a Mach 2.75 wind tunnel. Stereo particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements were recorded in 25 planes that include all three possible orthogonal orientations. The lateral velocity and vorticity measurements help to explain the underlying flow structure and these quantities were not measured previously for this problem. It is concluded that the sidewall and bottom wall separation zones interact due to an underlying flow structure that is similar to the two types of 3-D separation patterns previously described by Tobak {\&} Peake (Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech., vol. 14, 1982, pp. 61-85). Separation first occurs at an upstream location where the shock interacts with the sidewall. Lateral velocities direct flow toward the centreline to cause separation on the bottom wall. This causes significant curvature of the shock wave, so that even the region near the tunnel centreline cannot be explained by conventional 2-D concepts. A number of critical points (saddle points, nodes, focus points) were identified. Results are consistent with the general ideas of Burton {\&} Babinsky (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 707, 2012, pp. 287-306) and help to provide details of how the sidewalls redistribute the adverse pressure gradient in space.},

abstract = {High-order overset interpolation has been shown to increase solution accuracy in CFD calculations that utilize high order accurate inviscid flux discretization schemes. The purpose of this effort was to investigate the effect of high-order overset interpolation on the solution accuracy of vortex propagation within Overflow solutions. This was accomplished by adding the ability to compute high-order donor interpolation weights using Lagrangian polynomial to the Suggar++ overset grid assembly code. OVERFLOW 2.2 has been modified to accept these interpolants through the use of the DiRTlib library which can be linked to the code. Simple test cases are presented that demonstrate the operation of the new OVERFLOW 2.2/DiRTlib/Suggar++ system and reiterate the need for the use of high-order interpolants to maintain the intended order of accuracy. These cases are also constructed to demonstrate that standard tri-linear interpolation on increased number of fringe layers is not sufficient to maintain solution accuracy, and that the high-order interpolants are required.},

Separating and reattaching flows pose severe tests for the models and the numerical procedures. Sorting out differences between computations and experiment that are attributable to either modeling or procedure is very difficult.

abstract = {The boundary layer is created on an infinite flat, plate by a time-dependent free-stream velocity vector, whose magnitude is independent of time but whose direction (as seen in plan view) changes at a constant angular velocity. The pressure gradient, at right angles to the free-stream velocity, induces a skewing of the velocity profile ; all components of the Reynolds-stress tensor are non-zero (using axes aligned with the wall and the flow direction). This flow has never been produced experimentally, but it has the merit of being simply defined and of having only the Reynolds number as a parameter, which greatly simplifies the analysis. The flow is studied theoretically using Reynolds-number scaling laws, and by direct numerical simulation over a range of Reynolds numbers. The simplest version of the theory is equivalent to existing theories of the Ekman layer. A higher-order version is presented and yields excellent agreement with the numerical results at three Reynolds numbers, with just one adjustable constant in each equation. The theory allows the extrapolation of the results to high Reynolds numbers. The Reynolds-averaged equations reduce to a one-dimensional steady problem, so that turbulence-model testing will be easy and accurate. Detailed data are provided for that purpose. 1. Introduction We consider one of the simplest situations that can produce a boundary layer with three-dimensional statistics. A set of boundary conditions is described below that could be accommodated with our existing numerical method and allowed a fairly simple presentation of the results, but produced a flow with a skewed velocity profile and a full Reynolds-stress tensor. The direct simulations conducted until now included, of course, three dimensional fluctuations. However, their bocndary conditions and therefore their turbulence statistics had a mirror-image symmetry in the x direction (for instance, the mean spanwise velocity and some elements of the Reynolds-stress tensor had to be zero by symmetry). There is now a drive to investigate in depth flows that are three-dimensional in the mean, because the flows of interest (planetary boundary layer, swept wings, curved ducts, and so on) are often strongly three-dimensional, and also because of the desire to extend and test some aspects of turbulence theory in more general situations (see the review by Bradshaw 1987). The flow under study is similar but not identical to the prototype of atmospheric shear flows, the Ekman layer. The laminar solutions are identical, and the turbulent solutions are comparable. Many turbulence models (for instance mixing-length and two-equation models) would fail to distinguish between the present flow and the Ekman flow. Deardorff (1970) and Mason {\&} Thomson (1987) presented large-eddy simulations of the Ekman layer. Direct simulations of that flow are now being},

Two bleed hole configurations were investigated in the NASA-Lewis Research Center 15 x 15 cm SWT: a hole perpendicular to the plate's surface (a normal hole) and one inclined at 20°. Both holes had a length-to-diameter ratio of 2.0 and all tests were performed at a Mach number of 2.46. Pressure sensitive paint was used to measure sur-face static pressure in the vicinity of the hole. Pilot tube measurements made downstream of the hole showed a three-dimensional shock originating near the hole's downstream lip. Flow visualization showed the extent to which limiting wall streamlines are disturbed by the hole's presence. An ethylene trace-gas technique was used to measure the mass flow rate through the hole. Fi-nally, dynamic measurements of the pressure inside the bleed plenum showed no unsteadiness at the conditions at which flowfield measurements were made.

The procedure for surface grid generation is decomposed into an algebraic meshing step, a hyperbolic meshing step, and a gap-filling step. This paper will focus primarily on the high-level plan with details on the algebraic step. The algo-rithmic procedure for the algebraic step involves analyzing the topology of the network of surface curves, distributing grid points appropriately on these curves, identifying domains bounded by four curves that can be meshed algebraically, concatenating the resulting grids into fewer patches, and extending appropriate boundaries of the concatenated grids to pro-vide proper overlap.

abstract = {Several shock/turbulent-boundary-layer interactions (STBLI) associated with Mach 2 flow over swept-compression-ramps at various angles of compression are simulated, and the dynamics of un-steady phenomena are examined. The mean flow properties as well as the spectral content exhibit an approximate collapse in the conical symmetry frame, the origin of which lies at the intersection of the ramp corner, separation, reattachment, and shock triple-point lines. The three-dimensional nature of the 'open' flow separation is discussed, and the relevance of various sources of unsteadiness is identified through a parameter sweep of compression angle. Significant low-frequency unsteadi-ness (two-decades below the dominant frequencies of the incoming turbulent boundary layer), of the type ubiquitous in spanwise-homogeneous STBLIs of comparable separation size and reverse flow probability but having a 'closed' separation, is not observed in the swept-compression-ramp interactions. This demonstrates that the unsteady dynamics of 'open' separations are distinct from their 'closed' separation counterparts, and that while the strength of streamwise reverse flow is a good indicator of unsteady dynamics in spanwise-homogeneous 'closed' separations, it is not a good indicator of unsteady dynamics in these 'open' separations. Mid-frequency unsteadiness (one-decade below the dominant turbulent frequencies) is observed in all interactions, increasing in amplitude with stronger compression. These frequencies are associated with Kelvin-Helmholtz shedding from the separated shear layer near the separation line and scale weakly with Strouhal number based on the local separation length. The downstream prominence of this mid-frequency unsteadiness is muted compared with spanwise-homogeneous interactions of comparable separation size due to the three-dimensional nature of the post-separation flow. High-frequencies resulting from fine-scale structures in the boundary layer are present throughout the interaction, scaling with the local outer-scale Strouhal number and completely collapsing in the conical frame, in-dependent of the separation length. It is conjectured that the 'open' nature of separation in the swept-compression-ramp interaction, lacking in strong mechanisms for constructive convective feedback through the recirculation, does not foster the absolute instability present in counterpart spanwise-homogeneous interactions, accounting for the absence of low-frequency unsteadiness.},

abstract = {New bleed and compressor face boundary conditions have been developed to improve the accuracy of unsteady supersonic inlet calculations. The new bleed boundary condition relates changes in the bleed hole discharge coef- ficient to changes in the local flow conditions; the local bleed flow rate can more than double as a shock moves forward over a bleed band in response to inlet flow disturbances. The stability margin of the inlet is strongly dependent on the throat bleed configuration since the locally rapid increase in bleed flow has a strong effect on the motion of the normal shock. The new compressor face boundary condition accounts for changes in the unsteady flow conditions at the compressor face by specifying the compressor face corrected mass flow or Mach number either as a constant or as a linear function of the stagnation conditions. The effects of inlet flow distur- bances on the flow at the compressor face are represented more realistically with this new boundary condition than with traditional fixed static pressure or mass flow conditions. Euler calculations of the dynamic response of an inlet flow to a flow disturbance at the compressor face with 20- and 90-deg throat bleed hole angles are reported. These results indicate that an extra margin of stability for the inlet is obtained with 90-deg bleed holes because the increase in bleed flow rate as the shock moves forward over a bleed band is much larger for 90-deg holes than for 20-deg holes.},

The setup was designed so that the location of the shock wave could be varied relative to the diffuser. As the near-normal shock wave was moved downstream and into the diffuser, an increasingly distorted, three-dimensional, and separated flow was observed. Compared with the interaction of a normal shock wave in a constant area duct, the addition of the diffuser resulted in more prominent corner interactions. Microvortex generators were added to determine their potential for removing flow separation. Although these devices were found to reduce the extent of separation, they significantly increased three-dimensionality and even led to a large degree of flow asymmetry in some configurations.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 by J.A.S. Threadgill and P.J.K. Bruce.The effects of interaction strength and configuration generality are the subject of an experimental investigation to assess the low frequency unsteadiness typically observed in Shock Wave Boundary Layer Interactions (SWBLIs). The core dominant mechanisms responsible remain disputed due to the lack of a broad approach for understanding what drives each mechanism across a range of interaction types. This paper forms the first part of an investigation to observe various interactions in a well characterized baseline environ- ment. Experiments have been conducted in the Imperial College London supersonic wind tunnel where three configurations of SWBLI have been tested, each with a strength of interaction designed to result in incipient separation: a) 14° compression ramp interaction (Mach 2.0), b) 8° incident shock re ection interaction (Mach 2.0), and c) normal shock in- teraction (Mach 1.4). Analysis has been conducted using high-speed planar two-component particle image velocimetry and schlieren photography to characterize the baseline ow and inspect shock unsteadiness. Each configuration exhibits similar levels of incipient separa- tion with probabilities of reversed ow between 12{\%} and 26{\%} in each frame. Significant energy content has been observed within the interactions at frequencies far lower than typically witnessed in a supersonic boundary layer, providing agreement with results in literature.},

Studies ranging from those conducted in the early post-war era to those performed recently are discussed. On the basis of the investigations described in this report, it is clear that vortex generators can alleviate shock-induced boundary layer separation. Yet, it will be shown that their potential and efficiency varies considerably in practical applications. Much more success is reported in transonic test cases compared to separation induced in purely supersonic interactions. Under a variety of flow conditions, the best performance is achieved with vortex generators with a height of roughly half the boundary layer thickness and a shape similar to a swept vane. Notwithstanding this, vortex generator performance is not as consistent as it is in low-speed applications. Further work is required before vortex generators can be implemented into the design process for eliminating shock-induced separation on transonic wings and in supersonic inlets.},

@article{Titchener2013,
abstract = {To investigate whether vortex generators can be an effective form of passive flow control an experimental investigation has been conducted in a small-scale wind tunnel. With specific emphasis on supersonic inlet applications flow separation was initiated using a combined terminal shock wave and subsonic diffuser: a configuration that has been developed as a part of a program to produce a more inlet-relevant flowfield in a small-scale wind tunnel than previous studies. When flow control was initially introduced little overall flow improvement was obtained as the losses tended to be redistributed instead of removed. It became apparent that there existed a strong coupling between the center-span flow and the corner flows. As a consequence, only when flow control was applied to both the corner flows and center-span flow was a significant flow improvement obtained.

This test was conducted for the purposes of exploring boundary layer control through mass flow removal and does not address issues of stability bleed. Parametric data consist of bleed region flow coefficient as a function of Mach number, bleed plenum pressure, and bleed orifice geometry. Seven multiple hole configurations and two single slot configurations were tested over a supersonic Mach number range of 1.3 to 2.5 (nominal). Advantages gained by using multiple holes in a bleed region instead of a single spanwise slot are discussed and the issue of modeling an entire array of bleed orifices based on the performance of a single orifice is addressed. Preconditioning the flow approaching a 90 degree inclined (normal) hole configuration resulted in a significant improvement in the performance of the configuration. The same preconditioning caused only subtle changes in performance for a 20 degree inclined (slanted) configuration.},

abstract = {A suction muffler is frequently used to control noise generated by impulsive pressure fluctuation induced by the piston/valve in a reciprocating compressor. However, the suction muffler adversely affects the compressor performance because it causes an additional pressure drop and heat transfer. In this study, with the aim of considering the complex interaction between acoustic waves and flow, both the flow performance and the acoustic performance of a suction muffler are simultaneously investigated by solving three-dimensional compressible Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations with high-order computational aeroacoustics schemes. To confirm the validity of the proposed numerical scheme for the simulation of acoustic waves, the transmission loss of a simple expansion muffler is predicted and compared with theoretical and experimental results. Then, performances of the target suction muffler are predicted and analyzed. On the basis of the analysis results, a new muffler is designed and its performances are predicted and compared with those of the original one. Finally, validation experiments are performed, whose results confirm improvements in the flow and acoustic performances of the new muffler design.},

abstract = {A novel vortex generator, termed as " slotted vortex generator, " is proposed in this study. Computations are conducted for supersonic flow at a freestream Mach number of 2.5 past single vortex generators of three different heights. For each device height h, three values of the slot radius r  0.3h, 0.4h, and 0.6h are used. Comparisons made with a standard wedge-type vortex generator using streamwise-velocity profiles, near-surface streamwise-velocity contours, pitot pressure deficit contours, etc., indicate that the new device has less device drag and produces fuller near-surface streamwise velocities downstream of the device. It is observed that the primary counter-rotating vortex pair formed due to the vortex generator lifts off at a slower rate when a slotted vortex generator is used. Computations of an impinging oblique-shock/boundary-layer interaction at Mach 2.5 for a flow turning angle of 7 deg, with flow control using (separately) an array of slotted and standard vortex generators, indicate that the slotted vortex generators with r∕h  0.6 are most effective in reducing the region with reversed flow when placed closer to the shock/ boundary-layer interaction region.

abstract = {In this paper, the DDES (Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation) is applied to study the spanwise suction control effect on wind-induced effect of a static bridge deck. Isolated suction holes are arranged on the lower surface of the test model in spanwise direction, and based on previous studies of similar bluff body, a proper distance of spanwise suction was chosen to trigger or amplify the most unstable secondary instability (i.e. Mode A) in wake. The simulation results show that the suction arranged close to the wake has the best control effect on reducing the fluctuating aerodynamic forces. Due to the mean-velocity modification by isolated spanwise suction, the virtual aerodynamic shape modification is generated, which could act as spanwise perturbation to suppress spanwise vortexes. The results indicate that the spanwise suction could trigger or amplify the Mode A instability, and hence lead to the dislocation of the spanwsie vortex or even completely suppress the spanwise vortex. In addition, the spanwise suction control can surpress spanwise vortex shedding in a wide Re range.},

abstract = {Shock-Boundary Layer Interaction (SBLI) often occurs in supersonic/hypersonic flow fields. Especially when accompanied by separation (termed strong interaction), the SBLI phenomena largely affect the performance of the systems where they occur, such as scramjet intakes, thus often demanding the control of the interaction. Experiments on the strong interaction between impinging shock wave and boundary layer on a flat plate at Mach 5.96 are carried out in IISc hypersonic shock tunnel HST-2. The experiments are performed at moderate flow total enthalpy of 1.3 MJ/kg and freestream Reynolds number of 4 million/m. The strong shock generated by a wedge (or shock generator) of large angle 30.96?? to the freestream is made to impinge on the flat plate at 95 mm (inviscid estimate) from the leading edge, due to which a large separation bubble of length (75 mm) comparable to the distance of shock impingement from the leading edge is generated. The experimental simulation of such large separation bubble with separation occurring close to the leading edge, and its control using boundary layer bleed (suction and tangential blowing) at the location of separation, are demonstrated within the short test time of the shock tunnel (???600 ??s) from time resolved schlieren flow visualizations and surface pressure measurements. By means of suction - with mass flow rate one order less than the mass flow defect in boundary layer - a reduction in separation length by 13.33{\%} was observed. By the injection of an array of (nearly) tangential jets in the direction of mainstream (from the bottom of the plate) at the location of separation - with momentum flow rate one order less than the boundary layer momentum flow defect - 20{\%} reduction in separation length was observed, although the flow field was apparently unsteady. ?? 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

Both tests were run at freestream Mach numbers of 0.61, 1.62 and 2.49. The flow misalignment study was conducted over a range of 0 to 30 deg. The results show that neither flow misalignment nor hole interaction has much effect on the flow coefficient for the subsonic case. For the supersonic cases, flow misalignment causes significant degradation in the performance of the slant hole. For the supersonic normal hole interaction cases, depending on the hole orientation, either an increase or decrease in overall flow coefficient was observed. The largest change in flow coefficient, 6{\%} increase at near choke conditions, occurred when the holes were oriented in line with the flow direction.},

Solution of the PDF equa-tion is achieved using a Lagrangian/Monte Carlo ap-proach. A unique feature of the method is its abil-ity to calculate the mean pressure gradient directly from the particles using a grid-free approach. This is accomplished by merging techniques borrowed from the field of smoothed particle hydrodynamics. Fur-thermore, these techniques have been implemented using a newly discovered algorithm which greatly re-duces the computational work in 1D. The particle method also incorporates a variance-reduction tech-nique which can significantly reduce statistical error in first and second moments of selected mean flow quantities. When combined with a second-order ac-curate predictor/corrector scheme, the resulting par-ticle method provides a feasible way to obtain accu-rate P D F solutions to unsteady compressible tur-bulent flow problems. Results have been obtained for a variety of quasi-1D flows to demonstrate the method's robustness.

The supersonic blowdown wind tunnel was operated at a Mach number of 1.5 and a freestream Reynolds number of 26 × × 10 6 m −1 . At M = 1.5 slot control bifurcated the shock to give a $\lambda$ shock structure that was significantly larger than that seen without control. The effect on the shock was fairly two-dimensional and persisted in the region between control devices, showing that three-dimensional control devices can have a global effect on the shock structure. In addition, slot control altered the nature of the separated boundary layer from a two-dimensional separation bubble to give highly three-dimensional regions of attached and separated flow. There is evidence that slot control also introduced streamwise vortices, which may help delay or prevent downstream separation.

The flow regimes of importance to hypersonic vehicles of current interest are discussed and the performance of experimental facilities currently available to study real gas phenomena associated with hypervelocity flight are briefly reviewed. Viscous interaction and real gas effects in hypervelocity flight at high altitudes are discussed with reference to the measurements which are required to support the development of improved prediction capabilities in this regime. Theoretical and experimental research on 2D and 3D shock wave/laminar boundary layer interaction relevant to the performance of control surfaces and inlets in hypersonic flight at high altitudes is reviewed. The Characteristics of transition regions in hypersonic flows are discussed with particular reference to transitional flows over nosetips and swept leading edges. Studies of shock interaction phenomena on indented nosetips are discussed, followed by a review of the surface roughness and blowing effects. Research to describe the characteristics of 2D and 3D regions of shock wave/turbulent boundary layer interaction in hypersonic flow is reviewed with particular reference to intrinsic unsteadiness and potential compressibility effects in these flows. This review is concluded with a brief discussion of observations suggesting a decrease in the spreading rate in shear layer mixing in hypersonic flow.},

@article{Bruce,
abstract = {An experimental investigation of the unsteady interaction between a turbulent boundary layer and a normal shock wave of strength M∞ = 1.4 subject to periodic forcing in a parallel walled duct has been conducted. Emphasis has been placed on the mechanism by which changes in the global flow field influence the local interaction structure. Static pressure measurements and high speed Schlieren images of the unsteady interaction have been obtained. The pressure rise across the interaction and the appearance of the local SBLI structure have been observed to vary during the cycle of periodic shock wave motion. The magnitude of the pressure rise across the interaction is found to be related to the relative Mach number of the unsteady shock wave as it undergoes periodic motion. Variations in the upstream influence of the interaction are sensitive to the magnitude and direction of shock wave velocity and acceleration and it is proposed that a viscous lag exists between the point of boundary layer separation and the shock wave position. Further work exploring the implications of these findings is proposed, including studies of the variation in position of the points of boundary layer separation and reattachment.},

abstract = {Experiments have been performed in a blowdown supersonic wind tunnel to investigate the effect of subboundary layer vortex generators placed upstream of a normal shock/turbulent boundary layer interaction at a Mach number of 1.5 and a freestream Reynolds number of 28 ? 106. The Reynolds number based on the inflow boundary layer displacement thickness was 26,000. Two types of subboundary layer vortex generators were investigated: wedge- shaped and counter-rotating vanes. It was found that the vane-type subboundary layer vortex generators eliminated and the wedge-type subboundary layer vortex generators greatly reduced the shock-induced separation. When placed in the supersonic part of the flow, both types of subboundary layer vortex generators caused a wave pattern consisting of a shock, reexpansion, and shock. The reexpansion and double shocks are undesirable features because they equate to increased total pressure losses. Furthermore there are indications that the vortex intensity is reduced by the normal shock/boundary layer interaction. Overall, the vane-type subboundary layer vortex generators were the more effective devices as they eliminated the shock-induced separation and had the least detrimental effect on the shock},

Almost without exception, today's models yield accurate predictions for either wall-bounded flows or free-shear flows—but not both. Because complex turbulent flows generally include both of these types of flows, a model that does well for one but not the other has little hope of yielding accurate predictions in complicated applica-tions. A back-to-basics analysis of the most commonly used turbulence models illustrates that use of some well-known models should be discontinued. The analysis also highlights the most promising models.},

The setup was designed so that the location of the shock wave could be varied relative to the diffuser. As the near-normal shock wave was moved downstream and into the diffuser, an increasingly distorted, three-dimensional, and separated flow was observed. Compared with the interaction of a normal shock wave in a constant area duct, the addition of the diffuser resulted in more prominent corner interactions. Microvortex generators were added to determine their potential for removing flow separation. Although these devices were found to reduce the extent of separation, they significantly increased three-dimensionality and even led to a large degree of flow asymmetry in some configurations.},

no flow control device (other than bleed) has proven capable of

This approach, which couples the accuracy and decreased grid-point requirements of high-order methods with the geometric flexibility of overset-grid methods, is demonstrated by its application on three benchmark-type problems. These include the inviscid convection of a vortex in an otherwise uni-form mean flow, the scattering of acoustic waves by a configuration of three circular cylinders, and the viscous, laminar flow over two circular cylinders in close proximity at a Reynolds number of 100. Partic-ular attention is paid to the effect that the one-sided differencing and filtering algorithms employed near computational boundaries has on the overall solution accuracy. The impact that the order of the interpo-lation used at overset grid boundaries has on the solution accuracy is also investigated. The results obtained here show that high-order one-sided filters and interpolation methods are required to obtain the maximum benefit from the high-order overset-grid approach.

@techreport{Baurle2011,
abstract = {A modeling framework for boundary layer effusion has been developed based on the use of source (or sink) terms instead of the usual practice of specifying bleed directly as a boundary condition. This framework allows the surface boundary condition (i.e. isothermal wall, adiabatic wall, slip wall, etc.) to remain unaltered in the presence of bleed. This approach also lends itself to easily permit the addition of empirical models for second-order effects that are not easily accounted for by simply defining “effective” transpiration values. Two effusion models formulated for supersonic flows have been implemented into this framework; the Do- erffer/Bohning law and the Slater formulation. These models were applied to unit problems that contain key aspects of the flow physics applicable to bleed systems designed for hypersonic air-breathing propulsion systems. The ability of each model to predict bulk bleed properties was assessed, as well as the response of the boundary layer as it passes through and downstream of the porous bleed system. The model assess- ment was performed with and without the presence of shock waves. Three-dimensional CFD simulations that included the geometric details of the porous plate were also carried out to supplement the experimental data, and provide additional insights into the bleed flow physics. Overall, both bleed formulations fared well for the tests performed in this study. However, the sample of test problems considered in this effort was not large enough to permit a comprehensive validation of the models.},

abstract = {Recent developments in strategies and software tools for overset structured grid genera-tion and domain connectivity are described. A scripting approach based on a library of grid generation script macros is adopted to speed up the grid generation process. Advances in this method involve the development of high level functions that encapsulate more complex grid generation tasks. Sample applications using the script library macros are given for several complex configurations. Advances towards automated and efficient domain connec-tivity is accomplished using a newly developed library of domain connectivity functions called Chimera Components Connectivity Library (C3LIB). The library contains standard interfaces to the various processes encountered in domain connectivity. Enhancement to the stencil search speed is accomplished via bounding boxes based on balanced index-space partitions, and replacement of global searches by local searches using space-filling curve segments. The performance of the parallel stencil search algorithm is illustrated via a set of test cases on practical complex configurations.},

@article{Loth2013,
abstract = {The normal shock wave/boundary-layer interaction is important to the operation and performance of a supersonic inlet, and the normal shock wave/boundary-layer interaction is particularly prominent in external compression inlets. To improve understanding of such interactions, it is helpful to make use of fundamental flows that capture the main elements of inlets, without resorting to the level of complexity and system integration associated with full-geometry inlets. In this paper, several fundamental flowfleld configurations have been considered as possible test cases to represent the normal shock wave/boundary-layer interaction aspects found in typical external compression inlets, and it was found that the spillage diffuser more closely retains the basic flow features of an external compression inlet than the other configurations. In particular, this flowfield allows the normal shock Mach number as well as the amount and rate of subsonic diffusion to all be held approximately constant and independent of the application of flow control. In addition, a survey of several external compression inlets was conducted to quantify the flow and geometric parameters of the spillage diffuser relevant to actual inlets. The results indicated that such a flow may be especially relevant if the terminal Mach number is about 1.3 to 1.4, the confinement parameter is around 10{\%}, and the width is around twice or three times the height. In addition, the area expansion downstream of the shock should be limited to the conservative side of incipient stall based on incompressible diffusers.},

abstract = {Novel vortex generators for boundary-layer control were investigated experimentally in a flowfield that contains a Mach 1.4 normal shock wave followed by a subsonic diffuser. A parametric study of device height and distance upstream of the normal shock was undertaken with two previously untested devices: ramped vanes and split ramps. Flowfield diagnostics included high-speed schlieren, oil flow visualization, and pitot-static pressure measurements. A number of flowfield parameters including flow separation, pressure recovery, centerline incompressible boundarylayer shape factor, and shock stability were analyzed and compared with the baseline. All vortex generators tested yielded an elimination of centerline flow separation but also increased the three-dimensionality of the flow via increased sidewall interaction. When located 25 o upstream of the normal shock, the largest ramped-vane device (for which the height was about 0.75 of the incoming uncontrolled boundary-layer thickness o) yielded the smallest centerline incompressible shape factor and the least streamwise oscillations of the normal shock. However, additional studies are needed to better understand the three-dimensional characteristics, especially the corner interaction effects.},

The specification is currently implemented with an XML file format which is portable across platforms and applications. The motion specification is capable of describing general rigid body motions, and eliminates the need to write and compile new code within the application software for each dynamic configuration, allowing client software to automate dynamic simulations. The interface is integrated with a GUI tool which allows rigid body motions to be prescribed and verified interactively, promoting access to non-expert users. Illustrative examples, as well as the raw XML source of the file specifications, are included.},

Good agreement has been obtained between Navier-Stokes, Euler, and wind tunnel results at Mach 6.

The statistical properties of the shock wave motion were determined over the intermittent region using time-series analyses of wall static pressure uctuation measurements. The standard deviation of the pressure uctuations, nondimensionalized by the local mean pressure, reached a maximum of 0.22 near the middle of the intermittent region. The ratio of the maximum standard deviation of the pressure uctuations over the intermittent region to the mean pressure difference across the intermittent region was calculated to be 0.43 for this oww eld. Both of these quantities demonstrate that the unsteady pressure loading caused by the shock wave motion has essentially the same magnitude in plume-induced separated oww elds as in oww elds produced by solid boundary protuberances.},

abstract = {This paper describes an experimental comparison of two passive approaches for controlling the shock interaction with a turbulent boundary layer: low-profile vortex generators and a passive cavity (porous wall with a shallow cavity underneath). This investigation is the first known direct comparison of the two methods wherein the advantages and disadvantages of both are revealed. The experiments were conducted with a normal shock wave in an axisymmetric wind tunnel. The shock strength (M = 1.56-1.65) was of sufficient magnitude to induce a large separation bubble, thus causing substantial boundary-layer losses. The low-profile vortex generators were found to significantly suppress the shock-induced separation and improve the boundary-layer characteris- tics downstream of the shock. However, the suppression of the separation bubble decreased the extent of the low total pressure loss region associated with the lambda foot shock system which results in a lower mass-averaged total pressure downstream of the shock. The passive cavity substantially reduced the total pressure loss through the shock system (and thus wave drag) by causing a more isentropic compression over a larger lateral extent. However, the boundary-layer losses downstream of the shock were significantly increased.},

@book{Bishop2006,
abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. The author's previous textbook "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted.},

abstract = {Recent advances in shock wave boundary layer interaction research are reviewed in four areas: i) understanding low frequency unsteadiness, ii) heat transfer prediction capability, iii) phenomena in complex (multi-shock boundary layer) interactions and iv) flow control techniques. Substantial success has been achieved in describing the phe-nomenology of low frequency unsteadiness, including correlations and coherent structures in the separation bubble, through complementary experimental and numerical studies on nominally 2-D interactions. These observations have been parlayed to propose underlying mechanisms based on oscillation, amplification and upstream boundary layer ef-fects. For heat transfer prediction capability, systematic studies conducted under the auspices of AFOSR and RTO-AVT activities have shown that for axisymmetric laminar situations, heat transfer rates can be measured and in some cases be predicted reasonably accurately even in the presence of high-temperature effects. Efforts have quantified uncer-tainty of Reynolds averaged turbulence models, and hybrid methods have been developed to at least partially address deficiencies. Progress in complex interactions encompass two of the major phenomena affected by SBLI in scramjet flowpaths: unstart and mode transition from ramjet (dual mode) to scramjet. Control studies have attempted to leverage the better understanding of the fundamental phenomena with passive and active techniques, the latter exploiting the superior properties of newer actuators. Of interest are not only reduction in separation and surface loads, but also the spectral content. Finally, SBLI studies have benefited handsomely from successful ground and flight test campaigns associated with the HIFiRE-1 and HIFiRE-2 campaigns, results from which which are woven into the discussion, as are limitations in current capability and understanding.},
annote = {very key document, esp unsteadiness


 Numerous studies have explored the
genesis of the prominent low frequency component inherent in SBLI, i.e., frequencies at levels well below the scales
associated with turbulence in the boundary layer. This low frequency component is accompanied by separation
shock foot movement and spanwise shock rippling, and has been documented to varying extent for all canonical
configurations of Fig.1.28–32 A series of closely coordinated computational and experimental studies during the last
decade, focused on nominally 2-D configurations, has provided plausible explanations for the observations. Results
from these efforts, are summarized in Section III. The structural differences between 2-D and 3-D separation,
specifically closed bubbles in the mean flow in the former versus open structures with little or no reversed flow
in the latter as discussed in Section II, are then employed to comment on factors in extending the analysis to 3-D




 The traditional approach for SBLI control has been through bleed techniques, which alter the near wall
low energy region to mute the deleterious effects of the interaction. The search for a more optimal solution has
taken several directions, including passive (e.g., microramps with and without auxiliary bleed) and active (e.g.,
plasma-based or microjet) control techniques. The combination of a better understanding of the unsteadiness and
the development of new high-bandwidth actuators has led to strategies that seek to leverage fluid instabilities with
small disturbances of suitable spectral characteristics with more potential for scalability. Some key results are
summarized in Section VI},

@article{Davis1997,
abstract = {Boundary-layer bleed is an invaluable tool for controlling the airflow in supersonic aircraft engine inlets. Incoming air is decelerated to subsonic speeds prior to entering the compressor via a series of oblique shocks. The low momentum flow in the boundary layer interacts with these shocks, growing in thickness and, under some conditions, leading to flow separation. To remedy this, bleed holes are strategically located to remove mass from the boundary layer, reducing its thickness and helping to maintain uniform flow to the compressor. The bleed requirements for any inlet design are unique and must be validated by extensive wind tunnel testing to optimize performance and efficiency. To accelerate this process and reduce cost, researchers at the NASA Lewis Research Center initiated an experimental program to study the flow phenomena associated with bleed holes. Knowledge of these flow properties will be incorporated into computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models that will aid engine inlet designers in optimizing bleed configurations before any hardware is fabricated. This ongoing investigation is currently examining two hole geometries, 90° and 20° (both with 5-mm diameters), and various flow features (see the following figure): The shock structure in and around the hole},

@article{Piponniau2009,
abstract = {A model to explain the low-frequency unsteadiness found in shock-induced separation is proposed for cases in which the flow is reattaching downstream. It is based on the properties of fluid entrainment in the mixing layer generated downstream of the separation shock whose low-frequency motions are related to successive contractions and dilatations of the separated bubble. The main aerodynamic parameters on which the process depends are presented. This model is consistent with experimental observations obtained by particle image velocimetry (PIV) in a Mach 2.3 oblique shock wave/turbulent boundary layer interaction, as well as with several different configurations reported in the literature for Mach numbers ranging from 0 to 5.},
annote = {In many aeronautical applications, parameters of critical importance are imposed
by unsteady conditions that can occur during flight, rather than steady conditions.
Although these events are rare or do not contribute much to the local average energy,
they can correspond to high local stress, which can affect the whole behaviour of
the system. In supersonic flows, an important case occurs when unsteadiness involves
shock waves producing locally large pressure fluctuations. They may act as strong
aerodynamic loads and are felt along the whole flow downstream of the shock
wave. This occurs in shock-induced separation, where low-frequency unsteadiness is
produced. The separated region and the shock wave system that develops upstream
of the separation line oscillate at low frequency, at least two orders of magnitude
lower than the energetic scales present in the upstream boundary layer. For decades,
the interaction with an incident shock and the compression ramp have been the
two most documented cases (see Delery {\&} Marvin 1986). A recent review of the
main properties of these flows can be found in Dolling (2001). The origin of these
low frequencies is not totally understood, and several models have been suggested
to explain their development. A major problem is to separate the low-frequency
shock motions, which appear when the flow is separating, from the motions related
to unsteady conditions of the upstream boundary layer. This type of unsteadiness
is typically based on upstream energetic scales and generate some corrugations of
the shock wave (Debieve {\&} Lacharme 1985; Wu {\&} Miles 2001; Garnier {\&} Sagaut `
2002). The associated frequency scales differ by two orders of magnitude from the
low frequencies of the shock motions.








do the shock
movements influence the instantaneous position of the separated region through some
upstream perturbations, or does the unsteadiness of the separated bubble impose the
large motions of the shock?},
