@article{Piponniau2009,
annote = {In many aeronautical applications, parameters of critical importance are imposed
by unsteady conditions that can occur during flight, rather than steady conditions.
Although these events are rare or do not contribute much to the local average energy,
they can correspond to high local stress, which can affect the whole behaviour of
the system. In supersonic flows, an important case occurs when unsteadiness involves
shock waves producing locally large pressure fluctuations. They may act as strong
aerodynamic loads and are felt along the whole flow downstream of the shock
wave. This occurs in shock-induced separation, where low-frequency unsteadiness is
produced. The separated region and the shock wave system that develops upstream
of the separation line oscillate at low frequency, at least two orders of magnitude
lower than the energetic scales present in the upstream boundary layer. For decades,
the interaction with an incident shock and the compression ramp have been the
two most documented cases (see Delery {\&} Marvin 1986). A recent review of the
main properties of these flows can be found in Dolling (2001). The origin of these
low frequencies is not totally understood, and several models have been suggested
to explain their development. A major problem is to separate the low-frequency
shock motions, which appear when the flow is separating, from the motions related
to unsteady conditions of the upstream boundary layer. This type of unsteadiness
is typically based on upstream energetic scales and generate some corrugations of
the shock wave (Debieve {\&} Lacharme 1985; Wu {\&} Miles 2001; Garnier {\&} Sagaut `
2002). The associated frequency scales differ by two orders of magnitude from the
low frequencies of the shock motions.








do the shock
movements influence the instantaneous position of the separated region through some
upstream perturbations, or does the unsteadiness of the separated bubble impose the
large motions of the shock?},

annote = {very key document, esp unsteadiness


 Numerous studies have explored the
genesis of the prominent low frequency component inherent in SBLI, i.e., frequencies at levels well below the scales
associated with turbulence in the boundary layer. This low frequency component is accompanied by separation
shock foot movement and spanwise shock rippling, and has been documented to varying extent for all canonical
configurations of Fig.1.28–32 A series of closely coordinated computational and experimental studies during the last
decade, focused on nominally 2-D configurations, has provided plausible explanations for the observations. Results
from these efforts, are summarized in Section III. The structural differences between 2-D and 3-D separation,
specifically closed bubbles in the mean flow in the former versus open structures with little or no reversed flow
in the latter as discussed in Section II, are then employed to comment on factors in extending the analysis to 3-D




 The traditional approach for SBLI control has been through bleed techniques, which alter the near wall
low energy region to mute the deleterious effects of the interaction. The search for a more optimal solution has
taken several directions, including passive (e.g., microramps with and without auxiliary bleed) and active (e.g.,
plasma-based or microjet) control techniques. The combination of a better understanding of the unsteadiness and
the development of new high-bandwidth actuators has led to strategies that seek to leverage fluid instabilities with
small disturbances of suitable spectral characteristics with more potential for scalability. Some key results are
summarized in Section VI},

annote = {looking to reduce separation in engine inlets using micro vg 


by moving the vg upstream, greater overall pressure recovery is achieved but leads to stronger or assymetric or unseady corner flows.


quote 
This highlights that any application of flow control in an
inlet-relevant flowfield must address both the sidewall/floor
boundary-layer interactions and the corner flow problem. To date,
no flow control device (other than bleed) has proven capable of
minimizing corner effects, and future research is needed to identify
nonbleed control methods.


if my research is applied to three d or to walls, this will be significant},
