At a minimum, only two input files are required to run a basic simulation: the grid file and an OVERFLOW input file. Additional inputs are needed for restarts (restart file) and for tracking the flow solution (FOMOCO input file). 

The flow is initialized to the conditions described in the input file. The \hl{minimum required} is the freestream Mach number, angle-of-attack, side-slip angle, and freestream temperature.



% \section{Visualization}
% 
% Tecplot is a CFD visualization and analysis tool for large data sets. It is capable of loading in the % OVERFLOW PLOT3D grid file format and can calculate important flow parameters such as density magnitude % gradient and plot by iso-surfaces. Tecplot also extracts slices of data, allowing line-plotting of the % important quantities. \cite{Tecplot2017}
